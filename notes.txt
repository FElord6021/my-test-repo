Lyrics to "Close in the Distance" from Final Fantasy XIV Online, by Masayoshi Soken

Whispers falling silently, drift on the wind
But I hear you
Our journey now a memory fading from sight
But I see you

Unbroken, promises we made so long ago
You're still here
Unspoken requiem for the river of tears

Flowing, winding, toward eternal sea
And yet our hope remains
Guiding, lighting the way
No time for mourning
Rises on a land reborn from the ashes
'Neath the heavens'
To sunset blood-red skies, tranquil after the storm
Blessed shadow

Turning, wеnding, always night follows day
The sun will shine again
Walk on, nevеr look back
Through you, we live

Tales of loss and fire and faith
Every word on our hearts engraved
In the dark you will not stray
Forge ahead, till the end, we pray

(end of song)
This is one of my favorite songs in the game due to the emotions tied to the songs performance. It serves as a ballad of our characters journey through the game, as to get to this point our character has experienced much loss and sacrifice through the base game and the prior 3 expansions. Yet this song tells us that despite the sadness, we still carry on.
